	<h1>JASNEET KAUR AULAKH</h1>
	
	<p>I am a qualified Optometrist working in the Optical industry for over 10 years. In 2020 I became interested in writing code
	and what started off as a hobby has become a passion I wish to pursue. After completing a short "introduction to python" course I decided to take
	the plunge and start a software engineering online course with HyperionDev. I reduced my hours at work and began a coding journey
	I'm still on, learning everyday and I absolutely love it! As well as increasing my knowledge in Python I was also introduced to Java and 
	have written a few of my own programmes. I hope to use my new skills to change career as a Java Developer. </p>
	<p>In my spare time I love to read and drink tea! I love to explore my creative side by baking and learning to play the piano. I also have a fondness
	for walking outdoors. In 2015 I travelled around South America for five months, trekking through the mountain ranges and walking the Inca Trail in Peru. 
	In 2017 I hiked to Everest Basecamp and raised over Â£3000 for The Nepal Earthquake charity. </p>
